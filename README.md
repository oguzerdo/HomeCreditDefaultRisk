This repo includes the scripts of a classification project created to predict the default risks of customers in the Home Credit Default Risk competition in Kaggle.

The space occupied by the data set on the disk is 2.5 GB and the content of the data set is as follows;

The data **consists of 7 different tables** and when each sub-table goes down, individual customer transactions are **multiplexed**. There is only one Unique ID belonging to a customer and these customers have more than one transactions in the sub-tables.

- **Application** table contains **307.511 observations**, besides it has **122** features.
- **Bureau** table contains **1.716.428** observations, while it has **17** features. 
- **Bureau & Balance** contains **27.299.925** observations, while it has **3** features. 
- **Previous** table contains **1.670.214** observations, besides it has **37** features.
- **POS Cash Balance** table contains **10.001.358** observations, and it has **8** features.
- **Installments Payments** table contains **13.605.401** observations, while it has **8** features.
- There are **3.840.312** observations and **23** feature in the **Credit Card Balance** table.



First of all, the variables were defined along with the detailed **EDA** outputs and all the steps within the scope of the project were reported on **github.**

The tables we mentioned above are combined with the Application table by looking at the **various characteristics** of their variables. The reason for doing this is that the **Application** table is the **main table**.

Throughout the project, **new variables** were tried to be produced as much as possible and the **effect** of the generated variables on the model estimation result was observed.

Due to the large number of observations, a **Debug** mode that can be controlled with **CLI** was developed and the errors that occurred were tried to be corrected.

After data pre-processing, the images of the train and test sets are taken from the **RAM** to the **Disk** environment and the future processes are **guaranteed**.

The project also includes the **Makefile** file. Using Makefile, frequently repeated operations **(model train, predict, tune, github commit, push, update, kaggle submit)** are made functional using a single command over the terminal.
